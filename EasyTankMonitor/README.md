Simple Program to Monitor the fill state of the OpenBlocks Tanks.


Some infos about how to use it.
- You have to set the correct Tank size inside the script to be able to calculate the filling state of your tank.
- Only rectangular tank sizes are allowed to be able to calculate the filling state correctly.
- Every layer of the tank needs to have a Wired Modem hooked up to it and connected via network to the computer you run the program of. (Note you have to change the peripheral names in the script)
